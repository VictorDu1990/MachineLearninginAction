# Steps for Machine Learning Application Development  
### 1. Data collection
  Crawling data from the Internet. Use measured data. Use open datasets.  
### 2. Data processing
  Formated datasets convenient for programming processing. such as Python/R.  
### 3. Data analysis  
  Check NULL values and abnormal values. Data dimensionality and virtualization analysis.  
### 4. Training model 
  Choosing an Appropriate Algorithmic Training Model.   
### 5. Test model  
  Test and evaluate the practical effect of the model. If NOT good, goto step 4 or step 1 try again.  
### 6. Use model  
  The machine learning algorithm model is transformed into an application program to perform practical tasks.
